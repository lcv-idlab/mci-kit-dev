Abstract: InstArt allows anyone to visit the museum and to create a personal "view" of the  exhibited artvpieces. The application enables the personal representation of what the museum visitor sees thanks to a customizable set of filters. The users can adapt the vision by changing the parameters like contrast, colours and brightness and to adjust them especially in case of visual impairments.

Description: 

The project is based on two main parts. The first is the mobile application that allows users to move around and see the art-pieces live on screen,  to change the filter parameters and then save the current view as picture. The second part is a website on witch the images taken by the users  are collected and shown.

A potential third device, a huge screen, can show  the pictures taken by the audience in the lobby of the museum, so that other people will be able to see how other see the exhibited art pieces.

Prototype: 

The prototype of the mobile application has been developed with Processing. The website is developed in html, css and javascript.
The mobile application runs on a mobile device or a mac with an usb camera clipped on the front. The sketch allows to change the contrast and brightness of the image by moving the mouse horizontally or vertically respectively. The filter can be applied by by clicking on the filter button and by moving right to left with the mouse (like black and white, inverted colours and so on).
Once the camera button is pressed, a picture will be saved on a dropbox folder that it is used to share the pictures on the website running on a second computer.
Thanks to a js script the website page checks the shared folder on dropbox and updates the list of pictures taken with the mobile device. The sorting of the pictures is chronological and it is based on the pictures file name composed as year-month-day-... and so on till .jpg.
The webpage use "Boubon Neat" to be responsive.
The painting used to develop the prototype is Paul Klee's Snail (1924).
